Rod Serling's achievements in playwriting, speech making and broadcasting are considerable and important. As members of The Rod Serling Memorial Foundation, we dedicate ourselves to promote and preserve this great man's contributions to the Arts and Humanities.

We pledge to educate the public about Rod Serling's genius and his passion, hoping that they will understand and appreciate his mastery of the creative arts, his unique understanding of human relationships, his esteem as a writer, his generosity as a speaker in and around Binghamton, and his uncompromising commitment to quality.

## The Founding of the Rod Serling Memorial Foundation

There were several attempts to memorialize Rod Serling following his death. Don Snyder, former general manager of WNBF-TV, in editorial on two different occasions, urged the community to remember Rod Serling in some significant manner. Through a well-received 1981 documentary entitled "Rod Serling: Remembered" on WMGC-TV, news anchor Julie Ross spurred public interest with a suggestion that Recreation Park or the high school might be named after Rod. On June 11th, 1983, Mayor Juanita Crabb and the Binghamton Local Development Corporation made possible the world premiere of "Twilight Zone The Movie" at the Crest Theatre in Binghamton New York.

### In February 1985, the Rod Serling Memorial Committee was formed. The founders:
